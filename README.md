For a privacy-compliance trade off, the code, processed data, and results will be visible, while the raw data will not. Thus, the exact analysis will not be able to be replicated. If necessary, please open an issue stating the reason and the identity of the requester. Requests will need to be approved and will be subject to an ethical declaration.
Processed data will be provided, allowing for the construction of models to be executed and analysed, as will the subsequent model evaluation and filtering.
